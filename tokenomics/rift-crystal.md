# ðŸ’² Rift Crystal

### What is Rift Crystal?&#x20;

Rift Crystal($RCY) is the token that supports the Riftverse economy. The total supply is <mark style="color:purple;">**$1,000,000,000 ($1 billion) RCY**</mark>.&#x20;

Rift Crystal will be airdropped first to the Genesis holders and/or by staking Rift Minions.&#x20;

Then, once the games are released, Rifters can earn RCY through in-game events, or purchased or traded through decentralized exchange.

### Utility

Rift Crystal is first used by the Rifters as a Governance Token, where <mark style="color:purple;">**$1 RCY**</mark> is acknowledged as one vote.&#x20;

Then, with the arrival of the Rift Marketplace, Rifters will use it to buy the most useful in-game items and unique NFTs to expand their in-game experience and perform specific in-game actions depending on the game they're in.&#x20;

Rifters can also use their rift crystals to trade services with each other or create missions with rewards

### Burning

The Crystal Rift will be a deflationary token with a maximum supply of <mark style="color:purple;">**$1,000,000,000 RCY**</mark>. However, there will be burn mechanisms built into the RiftVerse to ensure the health, value and stability of the currency.

#### Transactions in the Riftverse

All transactions made by players in the RiftVerse in Rift Crystal will be subject to a 20% fee in RCY.

* 18% will be redistributed to the RiftVerse treasury
* 2% will be burned

#### Genesis NFT Mint Event

Each new Genesis mint session will burn up to 20% of the amount spent in the session.&#x20;

#### Royalties

The equivalent of 20% of the secondary market royalties will be burned in RCY once a month until the last genesis season is released.

#### Other mechanics to come, depending on the governance of the community.
