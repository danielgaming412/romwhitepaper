# ðŸ‘©ðŸŽ¤ Rift Punks

### Lore

Punks are another race of the RiftVerse.

Unlike the witches, they donâ€™t get on well with nature, however they have gathered a vast amount of knowledge.

Real masterminds, they have mastered and tamed the power of the rift.

Passionate about science, punks used the power of Rift Crystals to create unimaginable technologies.

This strong blend of magic and science make the punks a fearsome race, disposing of terrifying weapons and vehicles.
