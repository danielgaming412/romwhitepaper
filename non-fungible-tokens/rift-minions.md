# üê∏ Rift Minions

## Lore

Adorable, aren‚Äôt they ?

Rift minions will be your friends all along this adventure.

These creatures have a special ability: they feel the magic.

With their incredible capacities, they‚Äôre able to find Rift crystals and bring them to their loved owners.&#x20;

They‚Äôre the secret to power, and exist in many forms, some are exclusive to the different worlds.

Will you be able to get them all ?

## Utility

Rift Minions can be stacked in our soon-to-be released Rift Minions Marketplace.&#x20;

Stacking them gives Rift Crystals.&#x20;

Rift Of Magic Genesis holders who get Rift Minions have a multiplier bonus. The longer they are stacked, the more they farm Rift Crystals.&#x20;
