### Dedalio - Lead Artist&#x20;

Crypto enthusiast and artistic designer for Rift Of Magic. I'm fascinated by Japanese culture and art in general. I'm an autodidact artist. Drawing was always a passion to me, and even today it still is more than a work. I do my best to deliver a charming and enchanting design in order for the Riftverse to feel a breathing and believable world. Hope this goal is more or less reached. Stay tuned because there is way more to come in terms of art and illustration for the Riftverse!
