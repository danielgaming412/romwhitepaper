# ü§ù Community Governance

### Governance by the Rifters for the Rifters

Rift of Magic is a community driven project that aims to create the most magical play to earn guild.

Your suggestions are more than heard and every time a decision must be taken, **you**, rifters, **are consulted,** creating the most tailored experiences.

To that end, there are positions to be held inside the community, the **OGs**, that have a massive impact.

Every 3 of them leads a different race. Only the most loyal, valuable and active members are able to reach this level. Moreover, these leaders have **dedicated seats** at our admins table.&#x20;
