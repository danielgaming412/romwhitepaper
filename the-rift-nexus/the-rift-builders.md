# ðŸ›  The Rift Builders

Rift of Magic provides a space for game developers to host their games and transform it as a play and earn experience for crypto and non-crypto users.&#x20;

Each game reaching the "games of the week" contest voted by the Rifters will be rewarded with _<mark style="color:purple;">**$6666 RCY**</mark>_ from the investment fund.

Players are rewarded by playing games, by reporting bugs, or suggesting upgrades. Rewards are in the form of Rift Crystals (_<mark style="color:purple;">**$RCY**</mark>_).&#x20;

The goal is to provide an opportunity for game developers to get their games noticed and for players to earn rewards while discovering new games and providing developers with valuable feedback.

**We want to create a win-win situation for everyone involved.**

More info to come on season 2 detailing the game submitting and the Rifters Feedback processes.
