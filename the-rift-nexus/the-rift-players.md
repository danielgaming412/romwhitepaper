# ðŸŽ® The Rift Players

The players will log onto the Rift Nexus launcher (Rift of Magic game launcher) to access the games.&#x20;

By using the wallet they used to mint a Rift Of Magic NFT, the Nexus will recognize the assets as playable characters to be used in the Rift games.&#x20;

Every game is linked to its own daily quests that reward the players with _<mark style="color:purple;">**$RCY**</mark>_.

The games will be accessible to everyone, **even if the player is not a Rift Of Magic NFT holder**, but Rifters will have access to more rewarded quests and have the power to vote for the game of the month.&#x20;

With Rift Crystals, Rifters can buy assets that will be compatible and usable in the Rift Games and have various in-game capacity.
