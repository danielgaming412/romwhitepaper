# ðŸ”® Introduction

## Lore

All eight races of the Riftverse were living peacefully, all in their own world, <mark style="color:purple;"></mark> separated from the others. Their mutual existence was a secret no one knew aboutâ€¦ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark> Until the Nexus disaster.

Each world contains a mysterious <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark> source <mark style="color:purple;"></mark> of power, giving life and <mark style="color:yellow;"><mark style="color:purple;"><mark style="color:purple;"></mark> energy to every living being. From these sources emanate **Crystals**, the **Rift Crystals**, which can be used in countless ways, according to your imagination and knowledge.

Obviously, every source has its own **limit**.&#x20;

Suddenly, and all simultaneously, a breach opens in every world.&#x20;

The cause? **Greed**.&#x20;

A greedy species of the RiftVerse exhausted the power of its world. Before draining their universe from the last magical drop, they managed to create a dangerous weapon, the Nexus. It was so mighty and heavy, close to a sun, or maybe more such as a black hole, that it collapsed in on itself.&#x20;

This slump echoed in all eight universes, tearing apart time and space, leaving a breach in each of the worlds, the famous Rifts of magic : magical purple breaches, that inspire nothing but death and destruction.

Opening the gates to the other worlds, the first reaction was fear of the unknown for the inhabitants of the RiftVerse.&#x20;

Fear slowly let its place to curiosity, and fairly quickly, greed has spread among the spirits.

That inevitably led some races to take advantage of this breach to steal the Rift crystals from other universes, establish their reign and proclaim their own Queen. <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>&#x20;

Get ready for the battle of the RiftVerse.

## Vision

We are aiming for a long-term project, with a low supply of 666 NFTs per iteration revealed over the seasons. This ensures that the people who buy the NFTs are truly passionate and are willing to build, with us, Rift Of Magic and forward effectively together.

This white paper aims to share with the interested public our vision, ambition and work done so far.&#x20;
